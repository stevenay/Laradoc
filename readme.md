## Laradoc (Laravel Documentation with Easy Search Features)

Laradoc is Lavavel documentation with search features. There are tons of concepts and functions in Laravel Framework and it's terribly difficult to remember all these things while developing. That's why most developers (almost every developer) always have to look documentation when they are not sure about what they code is in right way.

The problem is Laravel documentation has no search box. For example, I want to know what URL functions are available in Laravel. But there is no Documents titled with URL and where should I find it. In actual, URL functions are documented under **"Helpers"** document. 

Laradoc try to solve this problem by adding search box. You can make **4 types** of searching -
* Everywhere
* Article
* Topic
* Code.
By this way, you can use Laravel Documentation like API library and your development workflow will be improved better.
